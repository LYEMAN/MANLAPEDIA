        <h1> Types of motherboard</h1>
        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">AT Motherboard</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%"> This component acts as the brain of the computer, performing operations, sending
            instructions to
            other components of the system, and closesly collaborates with external hardware to manage I/O (Input and
            Output).</p>

        <br>
        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">LPX Motherboard </h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%"> The AT form factor is an old standard, which was primarily used in the IBM PC, the
            most prevalent personal computer of all time. This motherboard supported legacy intel chipsets and had
            relatively primitive I/O and connectivity.</p>

        <br>
        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">ATX Motherboard</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%"> The ATX form factor has been the most widely used standard of motherboard since 1995
            when it was created by Intel. Today, most desktop computers and even some servers use ATX form factor
            motherboards, as they have many of the modern requirements for a PC, like fast PCI-e Slots, SATA
            connectivity, support for Cutting-edge CPU architecture, modern and frequently-updated chipsets, and more.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">E-ATX Motherboard</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%"> Standing for Extended Advanced technology extended (Very intuitive). This form
            factor is a variant of the standard ATX motherboard, offering an expanded range of connectivity and thus is
            larger. </p>
        <br>
        <img src="../../Images/eatx.jpg" alt="cpu" style="height: 450px; width: 450px;">
        <br>
        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">Micro-ATX Motherboard</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%"> Micro-ATX motherboards are a more compact variant of the standard ATX motherboard,
            which offers a more compact size in exchange for less connectivity. These motherboards are backward
            compatible with the mounting hardware of ATX motherboards, which allow them to be installed into almost all
            systems. </p>

        <br>

        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">Mini-ITX Motherboard</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%"> Mini-ITX motherboards are even more compact than Micro-ATX motherboards, offering
            even less connectivity to allow for a very compact design, enabling users to build mini-PCs with the
            capabilities of full-fledged desktop PCs. </p>

        <br>
        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">BTX Motherboard</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%">An obsolete form factor which was created by intel in the early 2000â€™s to replace the
            aging ATX standard. It aimed to address the power and heat issues of the ATX standard, but was made obsolete
            by the advancement of low-power and efficient processors, starting with the Intel Core 2
            processors.

        <br>
        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">Pico-BTX Motherboard</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%"> An downscaled version of the BTX standard which allowed users and manufacturers to
            create more compact Computer systems. </p>
