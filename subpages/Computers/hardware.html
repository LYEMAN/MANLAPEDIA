        <h1 style="font-size: 180%;"> Hardware Concepts</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 150%"> Hardware can be further classified into two categories, External and Internal
            Components. Internal
            components are contained within the main structure of a computer, and usually are not directly physically
            interacted with by the user. On the contrary, external components are usually located outside of the
            computerâ€™s main structure, and often deals with input and output for the user. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 160%;"> Internal Hardware </h2>

        <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">CPU (Central Processing Unit) </h3>
        <p style="font-size: 140%"> This component acts as the brain of the computer, performing operations, sending
            instructions to
            other components of the system, and closesly collaborates with external hardware to manage I/O (Input and
            Output).</p>

        <p style="font-size: 140%"> A motherboard is a piece of technology that allows interconnectivity between the
            different components of a computer. It acts as the central bus for all information that is inputted into the
            computer, and all data that is outputted. This is further discussed in the main article for motherboards.

            use, and as
