                <p> Information systems are a collection of components that collect, manipulate, and disseminate data
                    and
                    information and provide feedback to accomplish a objective. </p>
                <p> Information systems are, by definition, a set of components designed to utilize data to accomplish a
                    certain task. Specifically, there are 5 components of a information system. Namely:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Human Resources and procedures:
                    This component is crucial, as without human guidance a system cannot run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Hardware:
                    This is the physical component that processes and deals with data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Software:
                    Software is the specific instructions and applications that the system uses to accomplish a task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Telecommunications:
                    This allows interconnectivity between all other components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Databases:
                    Data is the raw material that the IS uses to accomplish its task. This is where data that will be
                    used is stored.
                </p>

        <h1> Transaction Processing
            System </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 150%;"> This system directly supports the operations of an organization through the
            management of information and
            data at a lower level. It allows users to directly manipulate and organize data. It is used to update
            operational databases, and can be used for applications such as ATM systems, Cash register systems, and
            accounting systems. </p>
        <h1> Management Information system</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 150%;">Enables organizations to maximize the effective use of resources through the
            interpretation of data and information. It allows users to interpret information through analysis and
            reporting. Some examples of MIS are spreadsheet programs and Oracleâ€™s CPM. Enables organizations to maximize
            the effective use of resources through the interpretation of data and information. </p>

        <h1> Decision Support
            System </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 150%;"> A versatile and highly interactive system that is usually built proprietary for
            companies, catering for specific needs. It usually has functions such as What-If analysis, decision
            modeling, and Scenario Building. It allows for efficient and precise decision-making through various tools.
        </p>

        <h1> Executive Information system </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 150%;"> The EIS supports high-level strategic management by collecting information from
            multiple other systems (MIS and DSS) and integrating external information. It collects information and
            highlights trends in variables to allow decision-making and predictions. It is akin to a portal that links
            to all available information, allowing for executive decision-making.
